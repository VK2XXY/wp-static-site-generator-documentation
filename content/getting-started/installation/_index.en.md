Installing the plugin is done just like any other WordPress plugin. If you've done that before, this should be the usual process. If this is your first time, or it's been a while, no worries, we're going to walkthrough the whole process.

There are a few ways you can install this plugin:

 - from inside your WordPress [dashboard](https://en.support.wordpress.com/dashboard/)'s plugin search
 - by uploading a ZIP file through your WordPress dashboard
 - using the command line tool, WP-CLI
 - directly uploading a ZIP/folder to the fileserver
 - via the [Must Use Plugins](https://codex.wordpress.org/Must_Use_Plugins) special directory

This plugin **is** supported on [network/WPMU](https://codex.wordpress.org/Create_A_Network) installations. Just use the same process via the Network Admin's plugins page.

## Installing via the WordPress dashboard

From your dashboard, go to Plugins > Add New

![Add new plugin](/images/ui/add_new_plugin.png)

Here, you can either search the WordPress “plugin store” or upload a zip file of the plugin.

To install from the plugin store, enter “WP Static Site Generator” or just a keyword like “static” and you should see WP Static Site Generator in first position.
